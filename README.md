# Hopper
Kotlin/JVM IRC bouncer and multiplexer. Provides an HTTP API for reading and updating state. Uses websockets for pushing state change to clients.

Inspired by [Possel](https://github.com/possel/possel).

This project is managed [on Trello](https://trello.com/b/KgFspfjh/hopper). It's in active development - probably not suitable for use before version 1.0!
